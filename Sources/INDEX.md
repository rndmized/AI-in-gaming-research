## Tactical Agent Personality
* ID: 107160 
* ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a novel agent personality representation model used to provide interagent adaptation in modern games,
coined as the Tactical Agent Personality (TAP). The TAP represents the tactical footprints of a game agent using a weighted network
of actions. Directly using the action probabilities to model an agent’s personality, removes the time and effort required by experts
to craft the model as well as eliminates the performance dependency on expert knowledge. The effectiveness, versatility, generality,
scalability, and robustness claims of the TAP architecture and its variations are applied and evaluated across a variety of game
scenarios, namely, First-person shooters (FPSs), real-time strategy (RTS) games, and role-playing games (RPG), where they are
shown to exhibit plausible adaptive behavior.

## Breeding Terrains with Genetic Terrain Programming: The Evolution of Terrain Generators
* ID: 125714 
* ABSTRACT: Although a number of terrain generation techniques have been proposed during the last few years, all of them have some
key constraints. Modelling techniques depend highly upon designer’s skills, time, and effort to obtain acceptable results, and cannot be used to automatically generate terrains. The simpler methods allow only a narrow variety of terrain types and offer
little control on the outcome terrain. The Genetic Terrain Programming technique, based on evolutionary design with Genetic
Programming, allows designers to evolve terrains according to their aesthetic feelings or desired features. This technique evolves Terrain Programmes (TPs) that are capable of generating a family of terrains—different terrains that consistently present the
same morphological characteristics. This paper presents a study about the persistence of morphological characteristics of terrains
generated with different resolutions by a given TP. Results show that it is possible to use low resolutions during the evolutionary
phase without compromising the outcome, and that terrain macrofeatures are scale invariant.

## Combining AIMethods for Learning Bots in a Real-Time Strategy Game
* ID: 129075 
* ABSTRACT: We describe an approach for simulating human game-play in strategy games using a variety of AI techniques, including simulated annealing, decision tree learning, and case-based reasoning. We have implemented an AI-bot that uses these techniques to form a novel approach for planning fleet movements and attacks in DEFCON, a nuclear war simulation strategy game released in
2006 by Introversion Software Ltd. The AI-bot retrieves plans from a case-base of recorded games, then uses these to generate
a new plan using a method based on decision tree learning. In addition, we have implemented more sophisticated control over
low-level actions that enable the AI-bot to synchronize bombing runs, and used a simulated annealing approach for assigning
bombing targets to planes and opponent cities to missiles.We describe how our AI-bot operates, and the experimentation we have
performed in order to determine an optimal configuration for it. With this configuration, our AI-bot beats Introversion’s finite
state machine automated player in 76.7% of 150 matches played.We briefly introduce the notion of ability versus enjoyability and
discuss initial results of a survey we conducted with human players.

## A Shortest-Path Lyapunov Approach for Forward Decision Processes
* ID: 162450 
* ABSTRACT: In previous work, attention was restricted to tracking the net using a backward method that knows the target point beforehand
(Bellmans’s equation), this work tracks the state-space in a forward direction, and a natural form of termination is ensured by an
equilibrium point p∗ (M(p∗) = S < ∞ and p∗• = ∅).We consider dynamical systems governed by ordinary difference equations
described by Petri nets. The trajectory over the net is calculated forward using a discrete Lyapunov-like function, considered
as a distance function. Because a Lyapunov-like function is a solution to a difference equation, it is constructed to respect the
constraints imposed by the system(a Euclidean metric does not consider these factors). As a result, we prove natural generalizations
of the standard outcomes for the deterministic shortest-path problem and shortest-path game theory.

## Single- versus Multiobjective Optimization for Evolution of Neural Controllers in Ms. Pac-Man
* ID: 170914 
* ABSTRACT: The objective of this study is to focus on the automatic generation of game artificial intelligence (AI) controllers for Ms. Pac-Man
agent by using artificial neural network (ANN) and multiobjective artificial evolution. The Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy
(PAES) is used to generate a Pareto optimal set of ANNs that optimize the conflicting objectives of maximizingMs. Pac-Man scores
(screen-capture mode) and minimizing neural network complexity.This proposed algorithm is called Pareto Archived Evolution
Strategy Neural Network or PAESNet. Three different architectures of PAESNet were investigated, namely, PAESNet with fixed
number of hidden neurons (PAESNet F), PAESNet with varied number of hidden neurons (PAESNet V), and the PAESNet with
multiobjective techniques (PAESNet M). A comparison between the single- versus multiobjective optimization is conducted in
both training and testing processes. In general, therefore, it seems that PAESNet F yielded better results in training phase. But the
PAESNet M successfully reduces the runtime operation and complexity of ANN by minimizing the number of hidden neurons
needed in hidden layer and also it provides better generalization capability for controlling the game agent in a nondeterministic
and dynamic environment.

## Artificial Intelligence in Video Games: Towards a Unified Framework
* ID: 271296 
* ABSTRACT: With modern video games frequently featuring sophisticated and realistic environments, the need for smart and comprehensive
agents that understand the various aspects of complex environments is pressing. Since video game AI is often specifically designed
for each game, video game AI tools currently focus on allowing video game developers to quickly and efficiently create specific AI.
One issue with this approach is that it does not efficiently exploit the numerous similarities that exist between video games not
only of the same genre, but of different genres too, resulting in a difficulty to handle the many aspects of a complex environment
independently for each video game. Inspired by the human ability to detect analogies between games and apply similar behavior on
a conceptual level, this paper suggests an approach based on the use of a unified conceptual framework to enable the development
of conceptual AI which relies on conceptual views and actions to define basic yet reasonable and robust behavior. The approach is
illustrated using two video games, Raven and StarCraft: BroodWar.

## Fine-Tuning Parameters for Emergent Environments in Games Using Artificial Intelligence
* ID: 436732 
* ABSTRACT: This paper presents the design, development, and test results of a tool for adjusting properties of emergent environment maps
automatically according to a given scenario. Adjusting properties for a scenario allows a specific scene to take place while still
enables players to meddle with emergent maps. The tool uses genetic algorithm and steepest ascent hill-climbing to learn and
adjust map properties.Using the proposed tool, the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive parameter adjustments when
setting up scenarios in emergent environment maps is greatly reduced. The tool works by converting the paths of events created
by users (i.e., the spreading of fire and the flow of water) for a map to the properties of the map that plays out the scenario set by
the given paths of events. Vital event points are preserved while event points outside the given scenario are minimized. Test results
show that the tool preserves more than 70 percent of vital event points and reduces event points outside given scenarios to less
than 3 percent.

## Enhancing Artificial Intelligence on a RealMobile Game
* ID: 456169 
* ABSTRACT: Mobile games represent a killer application that is attracting millions of subscribers worldwide. One of the aspects crucial to
the commercial success of a game is ensuring an appropriately challenging artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm against which to
play. However, creating this component is particularly complex as classic search AI algorithms cannot be employed by limited
devices such as mobile phones or, even on more powerful computers, when considering imperfect information games (i.e., games
in which participants do not a complete knowledge of the game state at any moment). In this paper, we propose to solve this
issue by resorting to a machine learning algorithm which uses profiling functionalities in order to infer the missing information,
thus making the AI able to efficiently adapt its strategies to the human opponent. We studied a simple and computationally light
machine learning method that can be employed with success, enabling AI improvements for imperfect information games even
on mobile phones. We created a mobile phone-based version of a game called Ghosts and present results which clearly show the
ability of our algorithm to quickly improve its own predictive performance as far as the number of games against the same human
opponent increases.

## Mining Experiential Patterns from Game-Logs of Board Game
* ID: 576201 
* ABSTRACT:In board games, game-logs record past game processes, which can be regarded as an accumulation of experience. Similar to a real
person, a computer player can gradually increase its skill by learning fromgame-logs.Therefore, the gamebecomesmore interesting.
This paper proposes an extensible approach to mine experiential patterns fromincreasing game-logs.Thecomputer player improves
its strategies by utilizing these growing patterns, just as it acquires experience. To evaluate the effect and performance of the
approach, we designed a sample board game as a test platform and elaborated an experiment consisting of a series of tests.
Experimental results show that our approach is effective and efficient.

## The Brigade Renderer: A Path Tracer for Real-Time Games
* ID: 578269 
* ABSTRACT: We present the Brigade renderer: an efficient system that uses the path tracing algorithm to produce images for real-time games.
We describe the architecture of the Brigade renderer, and provide implementation details. We describe two games that have been
created using Brigade.

## Fractal Analysis of Stealthy Pathfinding Aesthetics
* ID: 670459 
* ABSTRACT:This paper uses a fractal model to analyze aesthetic values of a new class of obstacle-prone or “stealthy” pathfinding which
seeks to avoid detection, exposure, openness, and so forth in videogames. This study is important since in general the artificial
intelligence literature has given relatively little attention to aesthetic outcomes in pathfinding. The data we report, according to
the fractal model, suggests that stealthy paths are statistically significantly unique in relative aesthetic value when compared to
control paths. We show furthermore that paths generated with different stealth regimes are also statistically significantly unique.
These conclusions are supported by statistical analysis of model results on experimental trials involving pathfinding in randomly
generated, multiroom virtual worlds.

## A Comprehensive Study on Pathfinding Techniques for Robotics and Video Games
* ID: 736138 
* ABSTRACT: This survey provides an overview of popular pathfinding algorithms and techniques based on graph generation problems. We
focus on recent developments and improvements in existing techniques and examine their impact on robotics and the video games
industry. We have categorized pathfinding algorithms based on a 2D/3D environment search. The aim of this paper is to provide
researchers with a thorough background on the progressmade in the last 10 years in this field, summarize the principal techniques,
and describe their results.We also give our expectations for future trends in this field and discuss the possibility of using pathfinding
techniques in more extensive areas.

## Performance Simulations of Moving Target Search Algorithms
* ID: 745219 
* ABSTRACT: The design of appropriate moving target search (MTS) algorithms for computer-generated bots poses serious challenges as
they have to satisfy stringent requirements that include computation and execution efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
performance and behaviour of existing moving target search algorithms when applied to search-and-capture gaming scenarios. As
part of the investigation, we also introduce a novel algorithm known as abstraction MTS. We conduct performance simulations
with a game bot and moving target within randomly generated mazes of increasing sizes and reveal that abstraction MTS exhibits
competitive performance even with large problem spaces.

## Games and Agents: Designing Intelligent Gameplay
* ID: 837095 
* ABSTRACT: There is an attention shift within the gaming industry towardmore natural (long-term) behavior of nonplaying characters (NPCs).
Multiagent system research offers a promising technology to implement cognitive intelligent NPCs.However, the technologies used
in game engines and multiagent platforms are not readily compatible due to some inherent differences of concerns. Where game
engines focus on real-time aspects and thus propagate efficiency and central control, multiagent platforms assume autonomy of
the agents. Increased autonomy and intelligence may offer benefits for a more compelling gameplay and may even be necessary
for serious games. However, it raises problems when current game design techniques are used to incorporate state-of-the-art
multiagent system technology. In this paper, we will focus on three specific problem areas that arise from this difference of view:
synchronization, information representation, and communication.We argue that the current attempts for integration still fall short
on some of these aspects.We show that to fully integrate intelligent agents in games, one should not only use a technical solution,
but also a design methodology that is amenable to agents. The game design should be adjusted to incorporate the possibilities of
agents early on in the process.

## Development of a Car Racing Simulator Game Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques
* ID: 839721 
* ABSTRACT: This paper presents a car racing simulator game called Racer, in which the human player races a car against three game-controlled
cars in a three-dimensional environment. The objective of the game is not to defeat the human player, but to provide the player
with a challenging and enjoyable experience. To ensure that this objective can be accomplished, the game incorporates artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques, which enable the cars to be controlled in a manner that mimics natural driving. The paper provides
a brief history of AI techniques in games, presents the use of AI techniques in contemporary video games, and discusses the AI
techniques that were implemented in the development of Racer. A comparison of the AI techniques implemented in the Unity
platform with traditional AI search techniques is also included in the discussion.

## A Multiagent Potential Field-Based Bot for Real-Time Strategy Games
* ID: 910819 
* ABSTRACT: Bots for real-time strategy (RTS) games may be very challenging to implement. A bot controls a number of units that will have
to navigate in a partially unknown environment, while at the same time avoid each other, search for enemies, and coordinate
attacks to fight them down. Potential fields are a technique originating from the area of robotics where it is used in controlling
the navigation of robots in dynamic environments. Although attempts have been made to transfer the technology to the gaming
sector, assumed problems with efficiency and high costs for implementation have made the industry reluctant to adopt it. We
present a multiagent potential field-based bot architecture that is evaluated in two different real-time strategy game settings and
compare them, both in terms of performance, and in terms of softer attributes such as configurability with other state-of-the-art
solutions.We show that the solution is a highly configurable bot that can match the performance standards of traditional RTS bots.
Furthermore, we show that our approach deals with Fog of War (imperfect information about the opponent units) surprisingly
well.We also show that a multiagent potential field-based bot is highly competitive in a resource gathering scenario.

## Turn-Based War Chess Model and Its Search Algorithm per Turn
* ID: 5216861 
* ABSTRACT: War chess gaming has so far received insufficient attention but is a significant component of turn-based strategy games (TBS) and
is studied in this paper. First, a common game model is proposed through various existing war chess types. Based on themodel, we
propose a theory frame involving combinational optimization on the one hand and game tree search on the other hand. We also
discuss a key problem, namely, that the number of the branching factors of each turn in the game tree is huge. Then, we propose
two algorithms for searching in one turn to solve the problem: (1) enumeration by order; (2) enumeration by recursion. The main
difference between these two is the permutation method used: the former uses the dictionary sequence method, while the latter
uses the recursive permutation method. Finally, we prove that both of these algorithms are optimal, and we analyze the difference
between their efficiencies. An important factor is the total time taken for the unit to expand until it achieves its reachable position.
The factor, which is the total number of expansions that each unit makes in its reachable position, is set.The conclusion proposed
is in terms of this factor: Enumeration by recursion is better than enumeration by order in all situations.

## Enhancing Video Games Policy Based on Least-Squares Continuous Action Policy Iteration: Case Study on StarCraft Brood War and Glest RTS Games and the 8 Queens Board Game
* ID: 7090757 
* ABSTRACT: With the rapid advent of video games recently and the increasing numbers of players and gamers, only a tough game with high
policy, actions, and tactics survives.Howthe game responds to opponent actions is the key issue of popular games.Many algorithms
were proposed to solve this problem such as Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)
but they mainly depend on discrete actions, while agents in such a setting have to learn from the consequences of their continuous
actions, in order tomaximize the total reward over time. So in this paper we proposed a new algorithm based on LSPI called Least-
Squares Continuous Action Policy Iteration (LSCAPI). The LSCAPI was implemented and tested on three different games: one
board game, the 8 Queens, and two real-time strategy (RTS) games, StarCraft BroodWar and Glest. The LSCAPI evaluation proved
superiority over LSPI in time, policy learning ability, and effectiveness.

## Narrow Artificial Intelligence with Machine Learning for Real-Time Estimation of a Mobile Agent’s Location Using Hidden Markov Models
* ID: 4939261 
* ABSTRACT: We propose to use a supervised machine learning technique to track the location of a mobile agent in real time. Hidden Markov
Models are used to build artificial intelligence that estimates the unknown position of a mobile target moving in a defined
environment. This narrow artificial intelligence performs two distinct tasks. First, it provides real-time estimation of the mobile
agent’s position using the forward algorithm. Second, it uses the Baum–Welch algorithm as a statistical learning tool to gain
knowledge of the mobile target. Finally, an experimental environment is proposed, namely, a video game that we use to test our
artificial intelligence.We present statistical and graphical results to illustrate the efficiency of our method.
