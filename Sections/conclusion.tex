\section{Conclusion}
Our aim in this research is to discuss some of the approaches to AI implementation in video games and what are the higher impact areas in that regard. We also described in what manned the industry requires AI to be developed to match players expectations. It is still a field in expansion, and even though more than 60 have elapsed since the creation of the first video game and almost as much since the first game implementing a basic AI system, video games evolved always using cutting edge technologies to deliver better experiences. Machine learning provided video games with a new edge. However due to this very same reason, there are little to no standards or frameworks that unify such technologies. The future of AI in gaming, as approached by Safadi el al.[15] by conceptualizing video games, "it becomes possible
to create solutions for common conceptual problems and use them across multiple video games. Developing solutions for conceptual problems rather than specific video games means that AI design is no longer confined to the scope of
individual game projects and can be more efficiently refined over time".

A unified framework would serve as a core, around which game developers would be able to build add-ons, decreasing the amount of resources for creating pathfinding models and behaviours from scratch and providing a stronger foundation for AI in gaming.
