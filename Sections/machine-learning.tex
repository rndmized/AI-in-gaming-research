\subsection{Defining Behaviour with AI}
Most games nowadays, either single or multi-player, have NPCs. Whether they are enemies, allies, unnamed or story characters it is important to define a behaviour pattern for therm to perform. However, players tend to reject erratic or inconsistent behaviour from agents, breaking game immersion. To create realistic behaviours that act in a more "human-like" manner is the aim of many AI researchers in the video game industry. In some cases, the goal of the agent is not to perform an action as perfect as a computer would, being the most efficient, but rather try to simulate imperfection. As well, in order for NPC to act as other players is necessary to emulate the lack of information a real player might have such as not being able to detect an enemy that is out of sight but act alert to the possibility of him coming.

Chek Tien Tan and Ho-lun Cheng[11] proposed an agent personality representation model to provide an adaptable agent that can perform across a variety of games of different genres exhibiting a plausible adapted behaviour.
